<h1>About my Pet</h1>
<p>The name “Benji” means little lion, but there's nothing fierce about this dog breed. 
  This pooch is a lover, not a hunter. Bred solely to be companions, Shih Tzus are affectionate, happy, 
  outgoing house dogs who love nothing more than to follow their people from room to room.</p>

<p>These furry sweethearts are originally the descendants of the Senji who were ancient Chinese wolves. 
  The name of the breed Shih Tzu means Lion Dog. Shih Tzus are said to be extra lucky dogs for you and they are very tolerant, trustful and make loving friends.</p>

<p>The canine ability to comprehend human body language and intonation is amazing. 
  Our dogs know more than just “Sit” or “Stay” or “Walk”. 
  They can learn the meaning of many words and can grasp that meaning even better when we say those words in an appropriate tone.</p>
